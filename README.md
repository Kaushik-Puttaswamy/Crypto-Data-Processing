# Crypto Data Processing and Analysis Pipeline Using AWS Glue, Kinesis, DynamoDB, Athena and QuickSight

## 📌 Project Overview

The Crypto Data Processing Pipeline is an end-to-end data processing solution designed to handle cryptocurrency transactions in real time. It leverages AWS Glue, AWS Lambda, Kinesis Firehose, DynamoDB Streams, and Hudi for efficient ETL and analytics. The project processes raw transaction data, performs transformations, categorizes trades based on risk, and stores processed data in an S3-based Hudi table for further analysis uisng AWS QucikSight.

• Real-time data ingestion from DynamoDB streams

• CDC (Change Data Capture) processing with Kinesis Firehose

• Spark-based ETL with AWS Glue and Apache Hudi

• Data lake storage with S3 and AWS Glue Catalog

• Interactive analytics with Athena and QuickSight

 	• AWS QuickSight (for visualizing insights)

2. AWS CLI & SDKs
	
 	• Install and configure AWS CLI:

	```pip install awscli```

	```aws configure``` 

3. Python & Dependencies
	
	• Install Python 3.x and required libraries:

	```pip install faker``` 

	```pip install boto3```

## 🏛 Project Architecture

![Project Architecture .png](https://github.com/Kaushik-Puttaswamy/Crypto-Data-Processing-and-Analysis-Pipeline-Using-AWS-Glue-Kinesis-DynamoDB-Athena-and-QuickSight/blob/main/Project%20Architecture%20.png)

### Data Flow:

• 1, Mock data generator → DynamoDB

• 2, 3 DynamoDB Stream → Kinesis Firehose

• 4, Firehose → Lambda (Transformation)

• 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Raw S3 → Glue ETL (Hudi Processing)

• 10, 11 Processed S3 → Athena → QuickSight


This project follows a real-time data ingestion and processing pipeline:
	
1. Data Generation (Mock Transactions)

	• A Python script (mock_crypto_data_to_dynamodb.py) continuously generates mock crypto transactions.

	• The data is inserted into AWS DynamoDB.

2. Data Streaming & Transformation

	• DynamoDB Streams captures changes and forwards them to AWS Kinesis Firehose.

	• A Lambda function (lambda_transformer.py) transforms the data from DynamoDB’s format to JSON.
	
3. Real-Time ETL Processing (AWS Glue)

	• AWS Glue reads data from S3 (landing zone).

	• Performs data transformations, including:

	• Risk flagging based on trade value.

	• Price normalization across exchanges.

	• Fee adjustments based on transaction size.

	• User categorization based on trade volume.

	• Writes processed data into an AWS S3-based Hudi table.
	
4. Data Storage & Analytics

	• Processed Data: Stored in an S3 Hudi table (processed_crypto_txn).

	• Querying: AWS Athena is used to query Hudi tables.

	• Visualization: QuickSight dashboards are built on Athena queries.

## 🛠 Setup & Execution Steps

Step 1: Configure AWS DynamoDB

• Create a DynamoDB Table (CryptoTransactions).

• Enable DynamoDB Streams to capture changes.

Step 2: Setup AWS Kinesis Firehose
	
 • Create a Kinesis Firehose delivery stream.
	
 • Configure Firehose to read from DynamoDB Streams and deliver data to S3.

Step 3: Create & Deploy AWS Lambda Function

• Deploy lambda_transformer.py to process data from Kinesis Firehose.

• This function:
	
 • Converts DynamoDB JSON format into standard JSON.
	
 • Adds metadata (event type, timestamp, event ID).
	
 • Outputs transformed data to Kinesis Firehose.

Step 4: Setup AWS Glue for ETL
	
 • Create an AWS Glue Crawler to catalog data from S3 (Raw Transactions).
	
 • Define a Glue ETL Job to process data using crypto_nrt_etl_glue_job.py.
	
 • Glue ETL performs:
	
 • Data Transformation
	
 • Trade Risk Classification
	
 • Price Normalization
	
 • User Categorization
	
 • Hudi-based storage in S3

Step 5: Query Data using AWS Athena
	
 • AWS Athena is used to run SQL queries on processed crypto transactions stored in Hudi tables.
	
 • Sample query:


``` select * from crypto.processed_crypto_txn limit 10; ```

``` select count(*) from crypto.processed_crypto_txn limit 10; ```

``` SELECT * FROM crypto.processed_crypto_txn WHERE risk_flag = 'MEDIUM_RISK'; ```

Step 6: Visualize Data using QuickSight
	
 • AWS QuickSight connects to Athena and visualizes trade risk trends, price normalization, and user activity.
	
 
 Insights include:

 • Trade Fee Collected
 
 • Exchange Comparison
	
 • Trading Volume per Trading Pair
	
 • Risk Distribution
	
 • Number of Trades by Status
 
 • Order Type Distribution
 
 • User Category Distribution

Step 5: Query & Analyze Data

Use AWS Athena or QuickSight to analyze processed data.

## 📌 Future Enhancements


🔹 Add Machine Learning Anomaly Detection for fraud detection.

🔹 Implement Kafka instead of Kinesis for higher scalability.

🔹 Support Multi-Region Data Processing for global transaction tracking.

🔹 Enhance Data Governance with AWS Lake Formation.
